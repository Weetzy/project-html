            <p class="norway__paragraph-1">It is believed that the name of this distinctive country and one of the most
                breathtaking places on our
                planet was given by the Old-Norse word Nordrvegr, literally meaning "way to the north."</p>
            <p class="norway__paragraph-2">Norway is famous for green forests and mountains, pristine glaciers, noisy
                and cool waterfalls, lakes,
                beautiful fjords, white nights, and the polar lights. The beauty of Norway cannot be described in words!
            </p>
            <p class="norway__paragraph-3">Norway is also known for its striking landscapes, hunting, fishing,
                interesting and entertaining history,
                and culture. All this attracts travel lovers who come to Norway regardless of the season from all over
